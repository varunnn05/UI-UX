# SkillFlex - Apply to Gig UI Design  (TASK 4)

This project presents a static UI design created in **Figma** for the "Apply to Gig" feature on a freelance platform called **SkillFlex**.

---

## Purpose

To design a clean and intuitive interface where users (freelancers) can:
- View gig details
- Write a brief application message
- Upload their portfolio
- Submit their application to the client

---

## Screens Designed

- **Gig Application Page**
  - Job title, gig description, skills, duration, and budget
  - A form area with textarea and file upload
  - Call-to-action buttons for Apply and Go Back

---

## Design Highlights

- **Color Scheme**: Rich gradient tones and dark backgrounds for a modern, professional look
- **Typography**: Font used – *Inter* (Google Fonts) for clarity and hierarchy
- **Components**: Rounded cards, skill tags, budget indicators, and interactive buttons
- **Layout**: Organized using Figma’s auto-layout and spacing features for visual balance

---

## What I Learned

- Structuring an application page layout from scratch
- Using spacing and alignment for clean design
- Improving component reuse (e.g., buttons, tags)
- Visual clarity using consistent text and color hierarchy

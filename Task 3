# SkillFlex Wireframes – Task 3 (UI/UX Internship)

## Overview
This repository contains low-fidelity wireframes for **SkillFlex**, a platform designed to help Indian freelancers discover and apply for short-term gig opportunities. These wireframes focus on layout, usability, and content structure — without any visual design or colors.

---

## Task Objective
Design three wireframes to demonstrate the layout and user flow for core screens of the SkillFlex app:

1. **Dashboard/Home**
2. **Gig Details View**
3. **Apply to a Gig**

---

## Design Decisions

### 1. Dashboard/Home
- Includes navigation tabs such as **Home**, **My Gigs**, and **Profile** for smooth user access.
- Sections are structured for better content hierarchy (e.g., featured gigs, active gigs).
- Simple footer and header to keep the focus on main content.

### 2. Gig Details View
- Important gig information like title, required skills, budget, and duration are placed at the top.
- Action buttons like **Apply Now** and **Save** are clearly positioned for visibility.
- Clean spacing and minimal distraction for a smooth reading experience.

### 3. Apply to a Gig
- Includes a field for the applicant to write why they're a good fit.
- Option to upload a portfolio is provided.
- A clear and prominent **Apply Now** button ensures easy submission.

---

## User Flow

> Dashboard → Gig Details View → Apply to a Gig

- The user begins on the **Dashboard** to explore available gigs.
- They select a gig to view details.
- They can then proceed to the **Apply to a Gig** screen to submit their application.
